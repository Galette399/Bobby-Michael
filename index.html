	<h1>Bobby Michaels - the guy from another planet with special powers</h1>
    <p>My character's name is Bobby Michaels. When you look at him you think he's just a normal person but he's not. He's a little chubby. He has shaggy brown curly hair, and he wears aviator glasses kind of like from the 80s. On his face he has two birthmarks one of a heart and one of a rainbow. His current and natural hair color is brown but sometimes he likes to dye it random colors. He has a very colorful style. He always where's colorful clothes.</p>
